Meta is still a prototype. Known bugs can be mostly derived from the pending
TODOs, which can find either inline, in the code, or in the file TODO.txt.

In the end, it will be able to parse any valid PHP code and return the
associated AST (or CST), perhaps it will even provide a small language
similar to XPath (nicknamed TreePath) to find nodes inside a tree by
their attributes.

For further information read the README. The tests are also useful to get an
idea of what can already be done.
