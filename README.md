Meta is a PHP extension module aimed at building the AST representation
of PHP source code files.

Meta is a prototype, I am still doing research to discover good ways
of implementing it.

Meta is going to fill the gap between Reflection, runkit and the tokenizer.

What it can be used for
=======================

Meta can be used for empowering your scripts with meta-programming
capabilities. For this, you need three things:

  * the *processor* - this is the file where you implement the callbacks;
  this is what drives the transformation from your meta-annotated
  script to the end result
  * the *source* - this is the code processed by the processor
  * the *transformation code* - this code is responsible for
  modifying the *source* according to your needs

In the end you will get a *processed script*. You do not need to
process the source to get a *processed script* as long as you
don't modify *the source*.

The *processed script* will be the one to be executed instead of
your *source*.

The exact way of hooking the *transformation code* into the process
is an open issue I am still researching on. There are two big ways:

  * the *transformation code* will be part of the *source*. In
  this case the hooking of the code will be done as a comment, so
  your *source* will still remain syntactically correct
  * the *transformation code* will be part of the *processor*.
  In this case, the *source* will remain clean

This sounds quite complex, but it could work seamlessly in modern
PHP applications. Modern PHP applications use the autoloading
functionality of PHP - you could arrange it such that the preprocessing
of the *source* is done there, as well as caching the resulting
*processed script*.

How to use it
=============

The API is still in the concept phase, but I'd like to hear from
you - I'm open to suggestions and ideas.


Internals
=========

Meta is using re2c for the lexer generator and a patched version of lemon
for the parser.

The extension is split in two, the scanner and the parser, each made
of two more components: the internal part and the runtime part.

`meta_scanner.{c,h}` and `meta_parser.{c,h}` contain the internal code,
not exposed directly to the runtime. The .c files are generated by
re2c and lemon from their .re and .y counterparts. Lemon and re2c
also generate two more headers, the `_defs.h` ones, which you
should not include directly, but through the `.h` files mentioned above.

`scanner.c` and `parser.c` contain the functionalities exported to the
runtime, through `meta.c`.

Coding conventions
------------------

Internal functions which could be reused are marked as `META_API`. All
these functions have the `meta_` prefix. The scanner specific
functions have the prefix `meta_scan` or `meta_scanner` and the
parser-specific ones have the prefixes `meta_parse` or `meta_parser`.
The parser also contains the `MetaParser*` functions, as generated
by lemon.

The scanner contains all the token-handling functions, which have
the prefix `meta_token_`, which the parser contains similar functions
for AST nodes starting with `meta_node_`.
