Meta is a PHP extension module aimed at building the AST representation
of PHP source code files.

Meta is a prototype, I am still doing research to discover good ways
of implementing it.

Meta is going to fill the gap between Reflection, runkit and the tokenizer.

Current status
==============

Currently, work is being done on constructing the AST tree programatically.

See a sample code in `tests/ASTUnaryNode_basic.phpt`.

To be done:

  * introduce classes for all language constructs out there (work has begun in
  `parser.c`)
  * make the scanner recognize all tokens (source: `php_scanner.re`)
  * make the parser parse any valid source code (source: `php_parser.y`)
  * introduce a non-obtrusive meta-parsing hook; this could be easily
  done by putting `#@myhook`. When the node following after this "meta instruction"
  is reduced, the hook is called, getting as parameter the AST node which has
  just been reduced (**A**)
    * alternative 1: the ASTTree holds a map of AST classes, if the user wishes
  to hook his code, he can extend ASTTree and the target AST node's classes,
  and a method like `ASTNode::reduce()` could be called (**B**)
    * alternative 2: the ASTTree receives as parameter a map of XPath-like
  expressions and callbacks. At reduction time, when an "ASTPath" is matched,
  the appropiate callback is called (**C**)

If and how A, B, C will be done, is subject to RFC. Any input is welcome.

Already done:

  * most of the work has been done by sitting in front of the whiteboard :-)

What it can be used for
=======================

  * meta programming
  * pretty printing
  * static code analysis

(each of them not by itself, but by providing the necessary infrastructure)

How to use it
=============

Please see the `tests/` to get an idea of how it could be used.
Keep in mind this is a work in progress, a prototype. The code
is rough and there are many TODOs (many of them documented though).

Internals
=========

Meta is using re2c as the lexer generator and a patched version of lemon
for the parser.

The extension is split in two, the scanner and the parser, each made
of two more components: the internal part and the runtime part.

`meta_scanner.{c,h}` and `meta_parser.{c,h}` contain the internal code,
not exposed directly to the runtime. The .c files are generated by
re2c and lemon from their .re and .y counterparts. Lemon and re2c
also generate two more headers, the `_defs.h` ones, which you
should not include directly, but through the `.h` files mentioned above.

`scanner.c` and `parser.c` contain the functionalities exported to the
runtime, through `meta.c`.

The internal lexer of the Zend Engine could not be used as it's bound
to CG (and as such, `php.ini`). The Meta's scanner is aimed at scanning
any kind of input, no matter if the host where it is run has `short_tags`
on or not, for example.

The ZE's lexer could not be used also because it doesn't keep some of
the terminal's values. `meta_scanner.re` does that if you provide
the appropiate flags (**NOTE**: not actually done yet, but the flags
fields are in place, both for the scanner, and the `ASTTree`).
This way, we can make the difference between
"echo" and "ecHo" - tools for checking the coding standard could be
written on top of that.

Also, one main priority is to be able to analyze php6 code just by
having the latest version of this extension, not necessarily php6
altogether.

As php 5.2 is not supported any longer, this extension is supposed to
work on 5.3+.

Roadmap
=======

With the 0.0.1 milestone ready, the user will be able to construct and
modify the AST tree of simple math expressions and statements.

As such, version 0.0.1 will be feature-complete, but only for a small
subset of the language.
